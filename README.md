# Portfolio of Projects

This repository showcases my work in **Computer Science** and **Data Science**, with projects in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **legal tech**. Below is a summary of the key projects, competitions, and my LeetCode solutions.

## Projects

### 1. **Undergraduate Research Fellowship & Thesis**
- **Description**: A comprehensive study on guardianship decision-making using machine learning models like decision trees and random forests to predict court-appointed guardianship decisions. Achieved up to 90.9% accuracy.
- **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Text Mining, Data Visualization.
- **difficulty**: 
As part of a research project funded by Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council, I conducted an empirical analysis of over 1,000 guardianship declarations to identify key judicial considerations for guardian selection. This project, executed solely by me, required overcoming substantial technical and logistical challenges, such as structuring unstructured legal texts, addressing data imbalance, and optimizing machine learning models. The first major challenge was structuring the data. Taiwanese judicial rulings often contain complex and varied Chinese expressions, making manual annotation infeasible. To tackle this, I used NLP techniques to preprocess and extract key variables. Specifically, I leveraged TF-IDF to identify relevant terms and patterns, while employing regular expressions to automate the encoding of case attributes. I also built a web scraping pipeline to extract large volumes of rulings, as existing judicial search engines did not meet the requirements of my research. After segmenting and organizing the data into structured datasets, I used stratified random sampling to address imbalanced classes, ensuring that underrepresented categories were appropriately included.Model evaluation and selection posed another significant hurdle. I tested multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best model for explaining factors influencing judicial decisions. Throughout the process, I relied on metrics like likelihood ratios, regularization techniques, ROC-AUC, and F1-scores to validate model performance. The final model achieved over 90% accuracy and was effective in identifying key decision factors. For data visualization, I utilized Tableau and R’s ggplot2 library to create dashboards that highlighted decision patterns and compensation trends, making the results accessible to broader audiences.This research not only sharpened my technical skills in Python, R, and machine learning but also underscored the importance of interdisciplinary problem-solving. By automating time-intensive processes and applying data-driven methods, I was able to conduct a comprehensive analysis that significantly advanced the understanding of judicial decision-making in Taiwan. The findings were later published in two law journal articles, showcasing the impact of this project on legal scholarship.
